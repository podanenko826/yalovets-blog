AWS can deploy one EC2 Key Pair to your EC2 instance. [But this approach has several disadvantages](https://cloudonaut.io/avoid-sharing-key-pairs-for-ec2/):

* You can only use one key per EC2 instance. But you shouldn’t share keys between users.
* Access to EC2 instances via SSH can not be restricted to specific users.

Therefore many of our AWS consultancy clients ask me:

> “How can SSH access be managed without too much overhead?”

If I ask what they mean by managing SSH access the following questions arise:

* How can only certain people access certain machines over SSH?
* How can I maintain a separate SSH user per employee to trace who did what?
* How can SSH access be revoked in case someone leaves the company?
* How can SSH public keys be rotated?

Wouldn’t it be nice if you could use IAM for that? Yes, you can!

## Solution

My preferred solution for managing public SSH keys is simple:

* Using IAM to store and retrieve public SSH keys. You may know about that if you use the CodeCommit service.
* Making use of sshd’s `AuthorizedKeysCommand` to retrieve the public key from IAM.

To see my solution in action run the following showcase. Skip the section if you are only interested in the theory.

## How to run the showcase

The showcase demonstrates how you can use your IAM user’s public SSH key to get access via SSH to an EC2 instance.

### 1. Upload your public SSH key to IAM

Open the Users section in the [IAM Management Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#users) and click the row with your user as demonstrated below.

![IAM Step 1](https://cloudonaut.io/images/2016/04/iam_list_users.png "IAM Step 1")

Click the “Upload SSH public key” button at the bottom of the page as demonstrated below.

![IAM Step 2](https://cloudonaut.io/images/2016/04/iam_user_security_credentials.png "IAM Step 2")

Paste your public SSH key into the textarea and click the “Upload SSH public key” button to save

### 2. Create the showcase stack

1. [![Launch Stack](https://cloudonaut.io/images/2016/01/cloudformation-launch-stack.png)](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home#/stacks/new?stackName=showcase\&templateURL=https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/static.cloudonaut.io/aws-ec2-ssh/showcase.yaml)
2. Click **Next** to proceed with the next step of the wizard.
3. Specify a name and all parameters for the stack.
4. Click **Next** to proceed with the next step of the wizard.
5. Click **Next** to skip the **Options** step of the wizard.
6. Check the **I acknowledge that this template might cause AWS CloudFormation to create IAM resources.** checkbox.
7. Click **Create** to start the creation of the stack.
8. Wait until the stack reaches the state **CREATE\_COMPLETE**
9. Copy the `PublicName` from the stack’s outputs
10. Connect via ssh `ssh $Username@$PublicName` replace `$Username` with your IAM user and `$PublicName` with the stack’s output

## How does it work

* On first start all IAM users are imported and local users are created
* The import also runs every 10 minutes
* On every SSH login the EC2 instance tries to fetch the public key(s) from IAM using sshd’s `AuthorizedKeysCommand`
* If the user is not found, login fails
* If no public key is available, login fails
* If the private key does not match with the public key, login fails
* You can restrict that the EC2 instance is only allowed to download public keys for certain IAM users instead of `*` (all). This way you can restrict SSH access to certain users
* As soon as the public SSH key is deleted from the IAM user a login is no longer possible

## Summary

Managing SSH access on AWS can be achieved by combining IAM and sshd’s `AuthorizedKeysCommand`. By restricting the `iam:GetSSHPublicKey` action to certain users you can restrict which users can access what EC2 instances. You can find the [source code on GitHub](https://github.com/widdix/aws-ec2-ssh). IAM public SSH keys are intended to be used with CodeCommit. My solution can be labeled a “hack”.
