Get started with AWS or broaden your knowledge while walking, biking, running, driving, or whenever you enjoy listening to podcasts. Our podcast series **AWS-to-go** will guide you through the most important aspect of AWS. To do so, we are going through each chapter of our book [Amazon Web Services in Action 3rd edition](https://www.manning.com/books/amazon-web-services-in-action-third-edition?utm_source=mwittig\&utm_medium=affiliate\&utm_campaign=book_wittig2_amazon_3_25_22\&a_aid=mwittig\&a_bid=7e8f8a13) together with Steffen, a web and front-end developer who just gets started with all things AWS.
