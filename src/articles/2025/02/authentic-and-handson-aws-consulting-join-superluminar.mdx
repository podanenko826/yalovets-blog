In 2015 - after building on Amazon Web Services for two years - I made a big decision. I wanted to become a consultant focusing on AWS. One of the best career decisions I have ever made. As a consultant, I worked with many different people in different industries and countries (Europe, US, India), from early-stage start-ups to mature enterprises. Over time, I was able to identify common pain points that many of my clients experienced. Back in the day, many clients struggled with EC2 patching, compliance, and of course, IAM policies. Over time, topics like containers, Serverless, and Infrastructure as Code gained traction. There is no other job where you learn so much.

Are you interested in a job like this? I have good news: [superluminar](https://superluminar.io/?utm_source=cloudonaut\&utm_medium=post\&utm_campaign=q4-2021), a cloud consulting boutique from Hamburg, wants to hire you! Before I go into details, let me share how superluminar identified a common pain point and how they solved it in the open.

## Common pain point solved by superwerker

The consultants at superluminar noticed a pattern: Before deploying business-critical AWS applications, you need to provision AWS accounts. Sounds easy? It turns out that this is more complicated than expected. A few examples:

* You need a unique email address for every account (not so easy in an enterprise).
* A baseline of security features is required in each account.
* A cross-account incident dashboard is required for 24/7 first-level support.
* Contact details and tax details need to be configured.
* User access needs to be managed.
* And of course, AWS releases new features that require reconfiguring everything from time to time (e.g., VPCs before/after Transit Gateway, or before/after AWS Organizations).

Instead of coming up with yet another commercial solution, superluminar decided to solve the problem for all of their customers and the rest of the world. They teamed up with kreuzwerker to start superwerker - an open-source project to help you get started with AWS quickly without investing in consultants or devoting time to extensive research. superwerker is a free and open solution that lets you quickly set up an AWS Cloud environment following best practices for security and efficiency so you can focus on your core business.
