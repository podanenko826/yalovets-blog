## What’s new?

The 3rd edition contains a new chapter covering containers on AWS: **Building modern architectures for the cloud: ECS, Fargate, and App Runner**. The chapter starts with the simplest way to deploy containers on AWS: App Runner. After that, we dive into our favorite architecture consisting of ECS to orchestrate containers and Fargate providing a Serverless container infrastructure.

Besides adding a new chapter, we have entirely rewritten chapter 15: **Automating deployment: CodeDeploy, CloudFormation, and Packer**. Automating the deployments is key to success in the cloud. Therefore, chapter 15 introduces three different options:

* CodeDeploy to roll out new versions of an application among a fleet of EC2 instances.
* Packer to bundle the latest version of an application into an AMI.
* CloudFormation to orchestrate rolling updates of EC2 instances managed by an auto-scaling group.

## What’s in the book?

Amazon Web Services in Action is an in-depth guide to AWS. The book consists of four parts.

1. Getting started
2. Building virtual infrastructure
3. Storing data in the cloud
4. Architecting on AWS

Here is a list of the services we cover in our book: EC2, VPC, IAM, Lambda, S3, Glacier, EBS, EFS, RDS, DynamoDB, ElastiCache, CloudWatch, Auto Scaling, Elastic Loadbalancing, SQS, ECS, Fargate, App Runner, CloudFormation, and CodeDeploy.

Besides that, the book includes our compressed learnings while building on AWS for ourselves and our consulting clients. We cover best practices to build secure and reliable systems in the cloud.

Infrastructure as Code is a game changer! We use CloudFormation for most examples in our book.
